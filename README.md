# Raid-Consumes

When using a macro called from this addon, it will use every consumable listed for that particular command until all buffs are active. Once they are all active, the macro will no longer function. When there is 2 minutes left on a buff or the buff has completely ran it's duration, only then will it allow you to click the macro again to reapply. 

The following macros work for the respective classes to put on commonly used full consumes for raiding.
