# Raid-Consumes (Vanilla 1.12.1)

**Raid-Consumes** is a comprehensive World of Warcraft (1.12.1) addon that provides an intelligent consumable management system with a visual GUI interface. It tracks buffs, manages cooldowns, and helps you efficiently use consumables during raids and dungeons.

**Latest Update:** Major overhaul with separate windows functionality, extended consumable support (25+ items), enhanced visual indicators, and comprehensive on-use item management including protection potions and instant-effect consumables.

## If you would like other consumables to be added, please let me know by opening an issue and giving me a list. Preferably provide the ItemID and BuffID, which both can be found on the database (https://database.turtle-wow.org/).
1. https://database.turtle-wow.org/?item=12451 <--- 12451 is the ItemID
2. Click on the buff that is listed on the item, which takes you to the buff it gives you. https://database.turtle-wow.org/?spell=16323 <--- 16323 is the buffID

## Commands

### Basic Commands

#### `/rc [consumable names separated by commas]`
- **Description**: Add new consumables to your selection.
- **Example**:
 - `/rc Juju Power, Elixir of the Mongoose`
   - Adds *Juju Power* and *Elixir of the Mongoose* to your saved list.
 - You can run this multiple times to add more. It will **not** overwrite older entries.

#### `/rc`
- **Description**: Toggle GUI visibility.
- **Behavior**: Shows or hides the consumable interface.

#### `/rc list`
- **Description**: Shows a list of all currently selected consumables and current settings.

#### `/usecons`
- **Description**: Attempts to apply all consumables you've selected (if you have them in your bags and do not have the buff or the buff is below the threshold).
- **Behavior**:
 - Will check each buff, see if it's missing or nearing expiry, and use the corresponding item if you have it.
 - If you *don't* have the item, you'll get a "You need to restock" messageâ€”but only once every 10 seconds to prevent spam.

### Configuration Commands

#### `/rc threshold <seconds>`
- **Description**: Sets the time threshold (in seconds) to reapply a buff.
- **Example**:
 - `/rc threshold 120`
   - Means if the buff has 120 seconds (2 minutes) or less remaining, the addon will try to consume that item again.

#### `/rc vertical`
- **Description**: Switch GUI to vertical button layout (top to bottom).

#### `/rc horizontal`
- **Description**: Switch GUI to horizontal button layout (left to right).

### Window Mode Commands

#### `/rc onuseonly`
- **Description**: Toggle showing only On-Use consumables in single window mode.
- **Behavior**: Filters the main window to show only items that require activation (protection potions, rage potions, etc.).
- **Note**: Automatically disables separate windows mode if active.

#### `/rc separateconsumes`
- **Description**: Toggle separate windows mode for on-use and regular consumables.
- **Behavior**: Creates two separate windows - one for on-use items, one for regular consumables.
- **Note**: Automatically disables onuseonly filter if active.

### Management Commands

#### `/rc remove <consumable>`
- **Description**: Selectively removes consumables from your rotation.
- **Example**:
 - `/rc remove Elixir of the Mongoose`
   - Will remove only Elixir of the Mongoose from your `/usecons` consumable list. Use `/rc list` to verify.

#### `/rc reset`
- **Description**: Resets and clears **all** currently selected consumables from your table.

#### `/rc help`
